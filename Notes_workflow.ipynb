    "1. What is a pyproject.toml file?\n",
    "\n",
    "TOML (Tom’s Obvious, Minimal Language): It’s a simple configuration file format (like JSON or YAML) but is easier to read and write. \n",
    "TOML is becoming the standard for Python packaging metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Why pyproject.toml is important:\n",
    "\n",
    "> It was introduced with PEP 518 to modernize Python package building. Previously, everything was done using setup.py \n",
    "  but now pyproject.toml allows for more flexibility, better dependency management, and cleaner project configuration.\n",
    "> It centralizes metadata about the project: project name, version, dependencies, authors, etc.\n",
    "> It supports various build systems (like setuptools, poetry, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Explaining sections of pyproject.toml:\n",
    "\n",
    "[project]: Defines the basic project information (name, version, description, authors).\n",
    "[tool.setuptools]: Specifies that setuptools is being used to build the project.\n",
    "[tool.setuptools.dynamic]: Links the external files (like requirements.txt) to dynamically pull dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. setup.py with the advent of pyproject.toml: Some tasks previously handled by setup.py (like metadata) are now managed \n",
    "   by pyproject.toml. However, setup.py can still be used, especially if you have complex build steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. How do setup.py, pyproject.toml, and requirements.txt work together?\n",
    "\n",
    "> pyproject.toml: It’s now the central place for project metadata. Instead of defining your dependencies and project \n",
    "  information in setup.py, you can define them in pyproject.toml.\n",
    "  As we did in your project, the line [tool.setuptools.dynamic] dependencies = {file = \"requirements.txt\"} links your requirements.txt \n",
    "  file to the TOML file, so when the project is built, the dependencies are fetched from requirements.txt.\n",
    "\n",
    "> setup.py: While it’s still used for custom builds and configurations, most of the basic functionality (like metadata and dependencies) \n",
    "  is being transferred to pyproject.toml. You might still keep a minimal setup.py if you have custom build steps, but for many projects, \n",
    "  it’s not necessary anymore with pyproject.toml.\n",
    "\n",
    "> requirements.txt: It lists all project dependencies and their versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run pip install -r requirements.txt, it ensures that all dependencies are installed. The pyproject.toml file can reference \n",
    "it (as we did) so that package dependencies are automatically pulled from there.\n"
